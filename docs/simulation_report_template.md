## 5. Cross-Industry Benchmarking

Dominates in:
- Automotive crash (19 kJ/kg SEA)
- Robotics tendons (fatigue + sensing)
- Marine mooring (corrosion + toughness)

## 6. Advanced Simulations

### Monte Carlo (±5% composition tolerance)
- UTS: 2,246 MPa ± 67 MPa (3%)
- Density: 2.00 g/cm³ ± 0.06 (3%)
→ Highly manufacturable

### Temperature Effects (-30°C to 80°C)
- UTS at 80°C: 1,900 MPa (>1,800 MPa min)
- Modulus at 80°C: 138 GPa
→ Still compliant

## 7. Next Steps

- Fabricate 1m prototype
- Static tensile test to 2.5 MN
- Dynamic drop test (64.8 MJ)
- Submit to NAWC for MIL-STD qualification
